# AI-Assisted Hacking: Key to Interoperability or Security Nightmare?

## Abstract
This paper investigates how modern large language models collapse the traditional "effort gap" in reverse engineering. Through two case studies, we show how AI-assisted analysis turns theoretical protocol knowledge into practical, replicable local integrations, and we assess whether this is a force for interoperability or a systemic security risk.

## Introduction
The rise of proprietary IoT ecosystems has made local interoperability difficult by design. This study asks:

> Is AI-assisted hacking a key to interoperability, or does it turn security through obscurity into a security nightmare?

This paper argues that the central barrier is not a lack of technical capability but the activation energy required to move from theory to practice. With AI, that barrier is shrinking, and the implications are both liberating and dangerous (Figure 1).

## Contributions
- Define the "effort gap" in modern IoT reverse engineering.
- Present two empirical case studies: Spider Farmer and EcoFlow PowerOcean.
- Propose a methodology for auditing AI-assisted research, including artifact analysis, documentation comparison, and commit-history review.
- Evaluate interoperability benefits against dual-use security risks.

- Right-to-repair, local control, and privacy in smart home systems.

The activation-energy framing is central to this paper (Figure 2): the thermodynamic endpoint — a working integration — is unchanged, but AI-assisted analysis lowers the barrier separating theory from practice.

## Case Study A: Spider Farmer
- System description and vendor control model.
- AI-assisted APK and protocol analysis workflow.
- Results: local Home Assistant integration and practical interoperability.

Figure 3 summarises the workflow.

The vendor surface (APK, on-device traffic, undocumented cloud endpoints) is collapsed by an LLM-assisted analysis loop into a working local Home Assistant integration. Prompt logs and transcripts are preserved as auditable research artifacts.](figures/fig3-spider-farmer.pdf)

## Case Study B: EcoFlow PowerOcean
- Energy management use case and system complexity.
- AI-assisted reverse engineering of undocumented APIs, packet formats, and device telemetry.
- Results: local monitoring, control, and reduced reliance on cloud services.

Figure 4 contrasts the vendor default (cloud-bound) with the AI-assisted local-control architecture.

Right: AI-assisted reverse engineering yields a protocol map and a local broker on the LAN, making the cloud optional and restoring data ownership.](figures/fig4-ecoflow.pdf)

## Methodology
- Data acquisition: APKs, firmware, packet captures, documentation, and prompt logs.
- AI-assisted analysis: combining generated and existing documentation with code and protocol inspection, including exported conversation transcripts as research artifacts.
- Version history review: commit and branch analysis to understand development evolution and research provenance.
- Validation: reproducing findings and documenting failed attempts.

The four-stage pipeline is summarised in Figure 5.

## Discussion: Interoperability vs. Security Nightmare
- The democratization of reverse engineering and the new "boredom barrier."
- Consumer sovereignty, right-to-repair, and local data ownership.
- Dual-use risks: vendor attack surface, rapid protocol discovery, and abuse potential.
- The future of IoT security: open APIs, zero-trust, and accountable design.

The dual-use character of the technology is shown in Figure 6: AI broadens the reachable distribution of outcomes, both legitimate and abusive. The structural answer is a shift in threat model (Figure 7), away from a single perimeter protecting implicitly trusted devices and toward authenticated, scoped access at every hop.

![Figure 6 — Dual-use map. Outcomes of AI-assisted reverse engineering plotted by interoperability gain (x) versus security risk (y). The dashed envelope shows how AI broadens the reachable distribution: legitimate use cases gain reach, but so do high-risk ones.](figures/fig6-dual-use.pdf)

![Figure 7 — Two threat models. Left: a single perimeter protects implicitly trusted devices — once breached, the whole system is exposed. Right: every hop is authenticated against a published specification; a breach stays local. AI-assisted reverse engineering punctures the left model and rewards systems built on the right.](figures/fig7-threat-models.pdf)

## Conclusion
AI-assisted hacking is a double-edged force: it enables local interoperability and user freedom while exposing the fragility of security through obscurity. The path forward is not to ban AI, but to design systems that do not depend on secrecy.

## Future Work
- Expand empirical evaluation to additional devices and vendors.
- Develop reproducible prompt templates and audit workflows.
- Propose a responsible disclosure framework for AI-assisted reverse engineering.
